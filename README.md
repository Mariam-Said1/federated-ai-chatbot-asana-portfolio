**Project Description**

This Asana project portfolio demonstrates end-to-end product management for a **government AI chatbot implementation**, showcasing expertise in cloud AI platforms, FedRAMP compliance, responsible AI principles, and cross-functional stakeholder coordination.

**Role:** Associate Product Manager

**Industry:** GovTech

**Project Duration:** January - April 2026 (3-month timeline)

**Tools Used:** Asana (Advanced), AWS/Azure AI Services (Conceptual)

**The Challenge**

Federal agencies need to modernize citizen services with AI-powered tools, but face unique constraints:
- Strict FedRAMP compliance requirements for cloud deployments
- Responsible AI governance to prevent bias and ensure transparency
- Complex stakeholder alignment across legal, security, engineering, and operations
- Long approval cycles for Authority to Operate (ATO) clearance
- Budget and scalability considerations for cloud AI platforms

This project simulates managing the implementation of an AI chatbot for a federal agency to improve citizen access to benefits and services information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**My Approach**

I structured this project into 6 key phases using Asana's advanced project management features to demonstrate realistic GovTech product delivery:

**Phase 1: Discovery & Requirements**
- Conducted stakeholder interviews with agency leadership
- Defined AI chatbot scope and use cases
- Reviewed FedRAMP compliance requirements
- Assessed data infrastructure readiness
- Identified cross-functional team members

**Phase 2: AI Platform Selection & Architecture**
- Evaluated **AWS vs Azure AI services** for chatbot capabilities (Lex vs Bot Service)
- Conducted cost analysis and scalability assessment
- Reviewed cloud security and FedRAMP authorization requirements
- Designed system architecture with AI/ML components
- Secured technical architecture approval from security team

**Key Decision Framework:**
- Natural language processing capabilities
- FedRAMP authorization status
- Integration with existing federal systems
- Cost structure for expected user volume
- Vendor government experience

**Phase 3: Responsible AI Framework**
- Developed bias testing protocol for chatbot responses
- Created transparency guidelines for AI decision-making
- Established data privacy and security protocols
- Defined human oversight and escalation procedures
- Documented responsible AI principles and ethics framework

Alignment with Federal Standards: This phase directly applies principles from emerging federal AI guidelines around fairness, accountability, and transparency.

**Phase 4: Development & Testing**
- Trained AI model with approved government data
- Integrated chatbot with existing agency systems
- Conducted internal UAT with pilot user group
- Performed security penetration testing
- Iterated based on feedback and fixed bugs

**Phase 5: Compliance & ATO (Authority to Operate)**
- Completed security assessment and documentation
- Submitted ATO package to authorizing official (SSP, risk assessment, PIA)
- Addressed security findings and remediation items
- Obtained final ATO approval
- Finalized compliance audit trail and records

**Government-Specific Deliverables:**
- System Security Plan (SSP)
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Continuous monitoring plan
- Incident response procedures

**Phase 6: Launch & Continuous Monitoring**
- Deployed chatbot to production environment
- Launched internal communications and training
- Monitored performance metrics and user feedback
- Conducted post-launch review with stakeholders
- Planned continuous improvement roadmap

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  **Key Features Demonstrated**
**Advanced Asana Workflow Specialist Skills**

**Custom Fields for GovTech Context:**
- Clearance Level (Public, Confidential, Secret) - tracking security classifications
- Compliance Status (Not Started, In Review, Approved, Blocked) - monitoring regulatory progress

**Timeline & Dependencies:**

**Why This Matters**

Modern product managers in **GovTech, healthcare, and enterprise environments** must understand AI systems conceptually to:

- Make informed decisions about AI-powered features
- Partner effectively with engineering and data science teams
- Navigate compliance and ethical considerations
- Scope AI capabilities realistically and avoid over-promising

This project demonstrates readiness to lead AI product initiatives in regulated, high-stakes environments.
